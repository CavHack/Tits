# Tits

Tits is a Decentralized Quantum Secured Ledger based on Bimodal Homomorphic Lattice Encryption with Gibbs Entropy. A Lamport Invariant Learning from Errors Crown Topology (DAG).  A modern interpretation of a distributed NoSQL Append-Only blockchain with Stochastic weights. Our blockchain proves secure against Shorr's algorithm by the introduction of a Random Oracle we name 'genisys_fx'. This new hashing mechanism is designed loosely on the problem of finding small vectors in lattices; Average case hardness of problems forms a basis for proofs-of-security for most classic cryptographic schemes. Most NP-hard problems lack this property. Tits aims, given a basis for a lattice, to output a new basis consisting of relatively short, nearly orthogonal vectors or palindromes.

The operation of the Tits Quantum Secure blockchain is based on the creation of transactions and construction of blocks that aggregate new transactions. New transactions are created by those nodes in a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) who wish to transfer their funds to another node. Each individual new transaction record is constructed and authenticated as it is Embedded in Tits consensus protocol- A Lamport invariant broadcasting mechanism for Kafka Events.


The speed of Tits is related to the Euclidean norm of a product 'Sc', wherein an invariant to the the traditional Eigenvalue problem is posited - the matrix S is the secret key and c is the challenge vector ('Sc'). On the other hand, Classical encryption schemes rely on one of integer factorization, discrete logarithm, and elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems, which can be effectively attacked by a quantum computer.

These are the traits of Tits which makes the blockchain secure against Quantum attacks:

Post-Byzantine Fault-Tolerance (Non-interactive zero-knowledge): the genisys oralce is a random oracle which responds to every unique query with a (truly) random response chosen uniformly from its output domain. A proof system is thus zero-knowledge if there is a simulator S such that no adversary who can make queries to the random oracle can distinguish from sigma protocols.
