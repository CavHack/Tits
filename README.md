# Tits

Tits is a Distributed Quantum-Secured Permissioned-on-Permissionless Ledger and Wallet (BoltzBrain) based on Ring Homomorphic Encryption. An Entropic  Lamport Invariant Learning with Errors (LWE) Crown Topology (DAG) with Genetic Self-Annealing Protocols. A modern interpretation of a distributed NoSQL Append-Only blockchain with Stochastic priority weights in its classification domain: Tits learns from Dependency Injecting vulnerabilities which enhances the Gaussian Flux of Hill-Climbing for adversarial and predictive analytics based on Network Tomography (SWIFTT). 

The Tits blockchain proves secure against Shor's and Grover's algorithm: We thus posit A high-security post-quantum stateless hash-based signature scheme that signs hundreds of messages per second on a modern four core, by the introduction of a cyclotomic ring (modulo prime ideal) with Random Oracle(genisys) One-Way Functions.  This new hashing mechanism is designed loosely on the problem of finding small vectors in lattices (SVP) which is essentially NP-Hard at worst; Average case hardness of problems forms a basis for proofs-of-security for most classic cryptographic schemes. Most NP-hard problems lack this property. Tits aims, given a basis for a lattice, to output a new basis consisting of relatively short, nearly orthogonal vector or palindromes.

The operation of the Tits Quantum Secure blockchain is based on the creation of transactions and construction of blocks that aggregate new transactions. New transactions are created by those nodes in a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) who wish to transfer their funds to another node. Each individual new transaction record is constructed and authenticated as it is Embedded in Tits consensus protocol- A Lamport invariant broadcasting mechanism for Kafka Events.


The speed of Tits is thus factored in relation to normed operators 'Sc' i.e: wherein an invariant to the the traditional Eigenvalue problem is posited - the matrix 'S' is the secret key and 'c' can be thought of as challenge vector ('Sc'). This is Quantum Secure, On the other hand, A Classical encryption scheme (RSA-Diffie-Helmann et al) rely on one of integer factorization, discrete logarithm, and elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems, which can be effectively attacked by a quantum computer.

These are the traits of Tits which makes the blockchain secure against Quantum attacks:

Post-Byzantine Fault-Tolerance (Non-interactive zero-knowledge): the genisys oralce is a random oracle which responds to every unique query with a (truly) random response chosen uniformly from its output domain. A proof system is thus zero-knowledge if there is a simulator S such that no adversary who can make queries to the random oracle can distinguish from sigma protocols.


Bernoulli Entropy Coding: The genisys oracle builds a sampler from a Gaussian distribution of arbitrary standard deviations and classifies rejection parameters based on stochastic principles.

(OTS) Stateless Merkle HyperTree: Instead of applying a public hash function to the message to determine the index of the OTS key pair, select an index randomly. It is then safe for the total tree height h to be somewhat smaller than the hash output length n: the hash output length protects against offline computations by the attacker, while the tree height protects against accidental collisions in indices chosen by the signer.
