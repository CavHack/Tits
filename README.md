# Tits

Tits is a Decentralized Quantum Secured Ledger based on Bimodal Homomorphic Lattice Encryption with Gibbs Entropy. A Lamport Invariant Learning from Errors Crown Topology (DAG).  A modern interpretation of a distributed NoSQL Append-Only blockchain with Stochastic weights. Our blockchain proves secure against Shorr's algorithm by the introduction of a Random Oracle we name 'genisys_fx'. This new hashing mechanism is designed loosely on the problem of finding small vectors in lattices; Average case hardness of problems forms a basis for proofs-of-security for most classic cryptographic schemes. Most NP-hard problems lack this property. Tits aims, given a basis for a lattice, to output a new basis consisting of relatively short, nearly orthogonal vectors or palindromes.
