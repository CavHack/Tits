Quantum Secure Blockchain based on Gibbs Entropy: A Stochastic Petri-Net Hashing through Lamport Clocks. A modern interpretation of a distributed NoSQL Append-Only Format. Furthermore, our guiding principle is a Dirac Soliton in the Network Tomography of Singularities genetic to some CA-DAG (Cellular Automata / Directed Acyclic C.A) with a genetic consensual rpc issuing 'EPR verification contracts' stored in a wallet.
